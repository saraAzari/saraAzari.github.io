            <h2>The Solution</h2>

            <h3>Key Features</h3>
            <h4>New Design System</h4>
            <p>Developed "Hopscotch," a new design system for internal products, inspired by and built on Vuetify's implementation of Material Design.</p>

            <h4>Opportunity Page</h4>
            <p>Redesigned opportunity page provides a clear overview of each opportunity, including client details, estimated value, service categories, and status. Enables sales reps to add multiple quotes with different categories and addresses, each with various package and term offerings. Includes a communication card for tracking emails, comments, and forms. Facilitates follow-up tasks with due dates and notifications.</p>

            <h4>Search and Advanced Search</h4>
            <p>Implemented live search for clients, opportunities, activities, and parent companies. Advanced search allows for detailed queries, saved reports, and sharing capabilities.</p>

            <h4>Linked Accounts</h4>
            <p>Enabled linking of client accounts under a parent company for accurate revenue reporting.</p>

            <h4>Meeting Tracking</h4>
            <p>Integrated with Google Calendar to track client meetings, providing insights into sales progress.</p>

            <h4>Sales Dashboard</h4>
            <p>Designed a dashboard to display key performance indicators (KPIs) at a glance, including quota, open opportunities, forecast, meetings, and monthly revenue.</p>

            <h4>Pricing Browser</h4>
            <p>Provides access to available products based on client address, enabling accurate and efficient quoting.</p>

            <h4>Myquotes Page</h4>
            <p>Created a temporary public URL for sharing live quotes with clients, streamlining communication and reducing manual effort.</p>

            <h2>Design Decisions</h2>
            <h3>Information Architecture</h3>
            <p>Prioritized search functionality with a prominent live search field on the dashboard. Utilized a left navigation drawer with two levels of entries, following the Hopscotch design system. Employed tabs to categorize related information and breadcrumbs for clear navigation and context.</p>

            <h3>Visual Design</h3>
            <p>Adhered to the Hopscotch design system for UI choices, ensuring accessibility and consistency. Created or modified components as needed.</p>

            <h2>Results and Reflections</h2>
            <h3>Outcomes</h3>
            <p>[Insert measurable results here, e.g., "User testing showed a 20% increase in task completion efficiency." ]</p>

            <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Emphasized the importance of clear and open communication with stakeholders, especially in a resource-constrained environment.</li>
                <li>Highlighted the need for flexibility and willingness to adapt designs based on user feedback and usability testing.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Next Steps</h3>
            <p>Currently working on the design phase of new features, including commission tracking and order submission templates.</p>
